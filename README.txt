1. hmda_init() function needs to be executed with correct file path's before executing any other code. Most of the functions and operations are dependent on the "combined" dataframe generated from the hmda_init() function.
2. Apart from the hmda_init() function, there is another place where the file path is to be changed. It is, where the editFile function is called while defining rules in data quality monitoring. However, if you set your working directory to the folder where all the files are present, then this will not cause a problem. So you need to set the working directory as the folder where these data files are located.
3. The ui.R and server.r files need to be placed in the same folder and both need to be opened to run the shiny app via runapp button or via the runApp() command. Shiny app's all plots will be visible properly when the window is in fullscreen mode.
4. For the shiny app to work, the dataframe "combined" needs to be loaded in the workspace and all necessary packages need to be installed and loaded.
5. If you get the error "Invalid graphics state" while creating any plot with ggplot, please  run this command dev.off() and then re run the plot. This occurs when ggplot2 installation gets corrupted.
